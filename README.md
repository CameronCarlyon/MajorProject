# Level 6: Major Project

**Introduction**

The major project will provide a period of sustained engagement with a chosen field of expertise and provide the opportunity for students to showcase their specialist practical skills. The project will allow students to develop their practical and theoretical skills by selecting, evaluating and analysing a pertinent issue within the contemporary computer games industry. Through the development of a major project students will prepare and submit a formal written report that engages with the theoretical, contextual and practical considerations of the project and the wider subject of computer games.
